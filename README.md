## 🔍 Current Interests

I am most interested in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically,
- developing new architectures for language models,
- variations of attention mechanisms, and
- knowledge representation from text.

At my lab, I study applications of LLMs and generating new architectures for NLP problems.
