My personal website is [www.ethanthoma.com](https://www.ethanthoma.com/), where I sometimes blog.

Currently researching under the supervision of Dr. Gema Rodriguez-Perez @ STASER Lab.

My research is on machine learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. If you have interest in what I am doing or have research you think I would be interested in, reach out.

My hobby projects are all hosted here. Some even have write-ups on my blog. I use all sorts of langs:
