I currently research under the supervision of Dr. Gema Rodriguez-Perez, where I focus on machine learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I've been working on.
I have a lot of random projects where I explore things, see my pinned repos below.
