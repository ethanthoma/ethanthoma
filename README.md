# Hi there, I'm Ethan Thoma üëã

I am a graduate student to the Master's in Computer Science program at UBC. I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Gema Rodriguez-Perez in machine learning (LM).

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I've been working on! Most of my research work will be private until published.

## üîç Current Interests

I am most interested in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically,
- developing new architectures for language models,
- variations of attention mechanisms, and
- knowledge representation from text.

At my lab, I study applications of LLMs and generating new architectures for NLP problems. 

## üî≠ Side Explorations

I mainly focus on ML and ML related topics. However, I do enjoy coding and learning new stuff:

- **Personal Website**: My personal website/blog. I learnt how to use Ocaml and a bit of Turso. [View Repository](https://github.com/ethanthoma/ocaml-webserver)
- **Loose Leaf**: A small component library for a TUI library called teashop. Written in Gleam. [View Repository](https://github.com/ethanthoma/loose_leaf)
- **ZigMat**: A very WIP zig library for matrix operations. Fairly optimized for matrix multiplication. [View Repository](https://github.com/ethanthoma/zigmat)
- **OpenAI Embeddings Script**: A concurrent Python script that loads data from BigQuery and embeds the text. [View Repository](https://github.com/ethanthoma/text-embeddings)
